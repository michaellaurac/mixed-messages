# Hospital appointment reminder

## Description :mag_right:
The project models a simplified hospital :hospital: online system on which the patient may ask to be reminded about their next medical appointment. 

Upon request the page will display a message including all necessary details for the patient not to miss the appointment :ambulance: with the medical professional :mask:.

The project displays a fictional :sparkles: message :envelope: randomly generated according to the requirements of the [**Mixed Message**](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/becp-22-portfolio-project-mixed-messages/modules/becp-22-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages) project from [**Codecademy**](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## Features :star::star::star:
The project features the following main elements:
1. An straight-forward title and an evocative illustration
3. A sober style respecting the theme
4. A series a patient actions described in the [instructions](#instructions)

### Dynamic behaviors :dizzy: 
Taking into account, the features implemented in the project a particular attention was paid to allowing some level of **_dynamism_** to the behaviors of each of the elements in order to practice with some **_event management_** aspects of the project.

### Object and data :package:
Additionally **_objects_** described by their respective **_classes_**, and **_data_** were included in separate **_modules_** and then integrated together.

### Code redaction :pen:

A high quality of code redaction was sought during refactoring using for example guard clauses.

### Project documentation :notebook:

Eventually, a significant amount of time was spent in properly **_documenting_** the project.

### Error handling :x:

Although partially included, **_error handling_** was not the primary focus of the project and was left as a possible future improvement.

## Instructions :mega::mega::mega:

### Appointment details

When landing on the page the patient can immediately read every appointment detail:

1. Time and location

   1. Date and time
   2. Location within the building
   3. Address of the building

2. Type of medical act

3. Medical professional
   1. Full name of the medical professional
   2. Medical department employing the medical professional

A text reminds the patient to bring the full relevant medical record to the appointment.

### Appointment confirmation

The patient is then invited to make a choice:

+ With the first checkbox the patient can confirm the appointment which is the default option
+ With the second checkbox the patient can request the appointment to be rescheduled

The choice can be submitted with the SEND button.

A confirmation is then displayed after either action.
